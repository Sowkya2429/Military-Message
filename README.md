It provides a user-friendly graphical interface implemented using the Tkinter library, along with support from the PIL and Pygame libraries for image display and sound effects.

# Features
Encode plaintext messages using the military encryption algorithm
Decode encoded messages to retrieve the original plaintext
Visualize encoded messages with images using the PIL library
Play sound effects or background music with the Pygame library
Intuitive graphical interface for easy message input and retrieval

# Usage
1. Launch the application
2. Enter a message in the designated input field
3. Click the "Encode" button to encrypt the message
4. The encoded message will be displayed
