It provides a user-friendly graphical interface implemented using the Tkinter library, along with support from the PIL and Pygame libraries for image display and sound effects.

# Features
Encode plaintext messages using the military encryption algorithm
Decode encoded messages to retrieve the original plaintext
Visualize encoded messages with images using the PIL library
Play sound effects or background music with the Pygame library
Intuitive graphical interface for easy message input and retrieval

# Usage
Launch the application
Enter a message in the designated input field
Click the "Encode" button to encrypt the message
The encoded message will be displayed
Click the "Decode" button to retrieve the original plaintext
